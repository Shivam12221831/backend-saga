// Local VS Global
local installation of any package is - npm install packageName

sudo chown -R $USER /usr/loacl/lib/node_modules
// This command is written because we need admin access before installing blobally.
// Not writting this command can give error.
// Then try global installation
global installation of any package is - npm install -g packageName
// After global installation we need to link it to run it without any error - npm link packageName
// So, steps are -
1- sudo chown -R $USER /usr/loacl/lib/node_modules
2- npm install -g packageName
3- npm link packageName
