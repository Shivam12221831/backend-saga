// REST (Respresentational State Transfer)
REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

// CRUD operations
- GET retrieves resources.
- POST submits new data to the server
- PUT updates existing data
- PATCH update existing data partially'
- DELETE removes data

--- Creating RESTful APIs
1. GET    -  /posts        to get data for all posts
2. POST   -  /posts        to add a new posts
3. GET    -  /posts/:id    to get one post(using id)
4. PATCH  -  /posts/:id    to update specific post
5. DELETE -  /posts/:id    to delete specific post

// Redirect 
res.send() - can display text, html, object
res.render() -> ejs files
res.redirect(url) -> can direct to another built-in page

--show route - get - /posts/:id
