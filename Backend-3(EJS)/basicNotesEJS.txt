// Templating - fixed layout 
EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript

** If we want to run our project from outside of the it directory then project will no show any response on site because it is unable to find views directory outside its main project directory.
So, to solve it we just have to add this two line in out index.JavaScript'
const path = require("path");
app.set("views", path.join(--dirname, "/views"));

// Interpolation Syntax
Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into marked up text.
** to know more go to "ejs.co" on browser and go to tags part

//Conditional Statements in EJS
Adding conditions inside EJS
<% if(diceVal == 6) { %>
<h2>Nice! Roll dice again.</h2>
<% } %>

// Serving Static files - like css and JavaScript
in ejs environment if we want to add static files like css and js then we can call app.use method
app.use(express.static(folder_name));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));

// Includes - 
Its provides sub-templates like ejs provide full page Templates
You just have to make a new folder inside views folder and name it as includes and add all sub-templates file here with extension name of .ejs
<%- include("includes/fileName.ejs"); %>
